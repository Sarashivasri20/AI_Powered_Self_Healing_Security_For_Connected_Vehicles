## OTIDS Dataset (CAN Dataset for Intrusion Detection)

The OTIDS (CAN Dataset for Intrusion Detection) is a dataset developed for evaluating intrusion detection systems (IDS) in Controller Area Network (CAN) bus communications within vehicles. The CAN protocol facilitates real-time data exchange among electronic control units (ECUs) in vehicles, but its design lacks source and destination address information, making it susceptible to unauthorized message injections that can lead to system malfunctions.

### Dataset Files

The OTIDS dataset includes several text files containing raw CAN bus data, attack scenarios, and metadata. Below are the filenames for the included text files:

- **Attack_free_dataset.txt**  
  Contains data from normal vehicle operations without any attack.

- **DoS_attack_dataset.txt**  
  Data representing Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on the CAN bus.

- **Fuzzy_attack_dataset.txt**  
  Data representing fuzzy attacks on the CAN bus.

- **Impersonation_attack_dataset.txt**  
  Data representing impersonation attacks on the CAN bus.
